# Deep Learning for Computer Vision - Project Work 1ab-1cd-1e

## Repository organization

Each project folder is composed of 
- a monolitic notebook (.ipynb) that contains all the code parts of the single assignment 
- the single files (.py) for each part of the project assignment. Each file is named with the specific part that is related to (for example, **project1cd3_1_bonus.py**, is the implementation of the notebook 1cd --> section 3.1 --> bonus part )
- the PDF file with the answers and analyses to the questions of the assignment guide

Therefore, the notebooks are:
- project1ab/1_ab_Intro_to_NNs.ipynb
- project1cd/1_cd_CNNs.ipynb
- project1e/1_e_Transformers.ipynb

The PDF of the answers to the questions are:
- project1ab/Report_1ab.pdf
- project1cd/Report_1cd.pdf
- project1e/Report_1e.pdf

## Installation and Usage
There is the possibility to run the single .py files or the notebook .ipynb file.
To run locally, each project is inside a specific folder and in each folder there is a requirements.txt file. Otherwise the notebook file could be uploaded and run on Google Colab.

# Important details
1) We have decided to provide both the .ipynb and the .py files, allowing the reader the choice to select the format they prefer. We guarantee that each .ipynb notebook file and its corresponding .py file are semantically identical.
2) In order to keep the repository lightweight, we have decided to not upload datasets or image results. Therefore, if one would like to run the individual .py files, the dataset should be downloaded first. 
3) This repository could also be found at https://github.com/RootLeo00/rfdia-lectures
